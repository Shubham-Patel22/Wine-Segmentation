# Wine-Segmentation
In this mini project, I have taken wine dataset from Scikit-Learn. And I performed Clustering on the data for Market Segmentation on wines produced by the winery. This project is an unsupervised learning take on the dataset generally used for classification. I feel that my work could help someone who is working on a similar project.
